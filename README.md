front-page
==========

Simplistic page for a gallery front page.

This is created for me to practice using javascript and jquery. 
Feel free to continue or to commit to the project.

The Plan
========

1. So what I actually wanted to do is create a div that will be positioned in the middle of the page.
Once the mouse is hovered over the centered div, more divs will appear around the centered div.

2. User can click on any of the just appeared div, and the user will be directed to another page with the clicked div
displayed in the middle of the page.
This new centered div will also have the hoving effect, just like the former first page div.

3. User can click on the newly created div, and will be redirected to a simple html gallery.
